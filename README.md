# Insights
A set of Python and R scripts to organize and analyze data from various sources and formats and make that data
easy to access and manipulate. 

# Dependencies
peewee >= 2.6.0

# Use
To use these scripts, download your Facebook, LinkedIn, and Google Takeout archives and place them in the same folder as 
these scripts. Then run setup.py. 

# Known Issues
Currently, setup.py does not work, you have to run scripts individually, and modify the paths to the archives yourself
as well. That is one of the priorities at the moment.
